"\ncaused by the corresponding fact iff for some p, it is a belief that p and p caused it.\nThe Crude Causal account is that one knows just if one’s belief is caused by the\ncorresponding fact. Being caused by the corresponding fact is a mark of truth:\nif p caused one’s belief that p then p is so. But it is not discernible: one could\nbe sufficiently attentive and mistakenly think that one’s belief is caused by the\ncorresponding fact while it is not. In the wake of the Gettier problem several\nExternalist Infallibilist accounts appeared.105\n\nBoth views face a weakening question. If the Internalist’s discernible prop-\nerty need not entail truth, would any discernible property do? If believing is\ndiscernible, any belief has some discernible property. Thus the weakest Falli-\nbilist Internalism identifies knowledge and true belief. In practice, Internalists\nrequire more: a discernible property that somehow indicates truth. Their task\nis to say what that involves and to motivate the requirement. For instance,\nsome Internalists require that truth be probable enough given one’s experience—\nwhich they take to be discernible. Their task is to say how experience makes\nsomething probable and to motivate the level of probability they require. Simi-\nlarly, if the Externalist’s truth-entailing property need not be discernible, would\nany truth-entailing property do? The weakest truth-entailing property is truth.\nThus the weakest Infallibilist Externalism identifies knowledge and true belief.\nIn practice, Externalists require more: a property that somehow makes it non-\naccidental that one believes the truth. Their task is to say what that involves\nand to motivate the requirement. As the True Belief account is a natural end-\npoint in the rejection of Classical Infallibilism it is no surprise that it appeared\nin the contemporary period.106\n\nFor a time the preferred strategy to answer the weakening question was to\nconfront candidate accounts to allegedly intuitive judgements about cases. A\nmore fruitful strategy is to ask what roles we except knowledge to play and\nhow they constrain acceptable weakenings. For instance, if we expect knowl-\nedge to enter an explanation of how one’s actions may be guided by facts them-\nselves, non-accidental true belief is arguably better suited to the task than true\nbelief.107\n\nInsofar as several weakenings appear to play legitimate theoretical roles,\none will be tempted by pluralist or variantist views according to which “knowl-\nedge” is ambiguous or context-sensitive. It is no surprise that such views have\n\n105Notably Goldman (1967); Unger (1968); Armstrong (1968); Dretske (1969); Nozick (1981). In\nthe current literature the prominent Externalist Infallibilist accounts are the safety (Sosa, 1993,\n1999; Williamson, 2000; Pritchard, 2005) and virtue-theoretic accounts (Sosa, 2007; Greco, 2010),\nas well as the combination of both (Pritchard, 2012). The virtue-theoretic account is more precisely\ncharacterized as a Two-tiered Externalist Infallibilist account.
