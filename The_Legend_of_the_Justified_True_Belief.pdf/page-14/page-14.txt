"\nOn the present account, Stoics require that it be discernible that beliefs bear cer-\ntain marks, which are in fact marks of truth; not that it be discernible that certain\nmarks are marks of truth. On another reading, called “externalist”, Stoics merely\nrequired that impressions had the right kind of causal history (Annas, 1990,\n197 and Barnes, 1990, 131–6). That makes it puzzling why Stoics did not point\nout that fakes and duplicates fail to show that no impression has the right kind\nof causal history. That also makes it hard to see why they thought that it was\npossible to assent only to impressions that are cognitive (Reed, 2002b, 155–7).\nOn the present account, the causal history of cognitive impressions matters\nonly because it confers them intrinsic features that are discernible (Frede, 1987,\n162).34,35\n\nment is ambiguous between two accounts. On the first, the Stoic view is that one can introspect\nwhether the feature in question entails truth. That is the “internalist” account Frede and I reject. On the\nsecond, the Stoics held that there is a truth-entailing feature such that one can introspect whether im-\npressions have it; but there is no claim that one can introspect whether the feature is truth-entailing.\nThat is compatible with Classical Infallibilism and not “internalist” in the sense above. Now Frede\nalso rejects the second account because he thinks that on the Stoic view, being attuned to cogni-\ntive impressions is not a matter of introspection but of exercising one’s sensitivity to their intrinsic\nfeatures (Frede, 1999, 315). However the non-introspective account is still within the bounds of\nClassical Infallibilism, because it is still held that a sufficiently attentive (i.e., exercised) subject will\nbe such that necessarily, they believe that a certain impression is cognitive just if it is.\n\n34A similar story can be told about another apparently externalist trend in Stoic epistemology,\nnamely the addition of a “no-impediment” clause to the Stoic definition of basic knowledge. Under\npressure from Sceptics, later Stoics added held that a cognitive impression should be “unimpeded”\nor “undiverted” (LS 40K). Some texts suggest that the “impediments” in question consist in the\ndysfunction of sense organs or an unfavourable position of the subject (LS 40L). Long and Sedley\n(1987, 251-252) conclude that later Stoics endorsed what amounts to a contemporary externalist\nposition: one knows provided that when everything is functioning normally, sense impressions\nare truthful. This would amount to a rejection of the discernibility requirement. I doubt the read-\ning is defensible: if Stoics had rejected it, Sceptics would have forcefully pointed it out and Cicero\nwould have reported it. Rather, I suggest that the Stoic view was that dysfunctions of one’s sense\norgans would be reflected in discernible aspects of one’s experience. Indeed, several other texts\nsuggest that the “impediments” of an impression are other impressions of the subject which in-\ndicate that the former impression is false, that is, defeating impressions (LS 40K, LS69E). (LS69E is\nabout Carneades’s notion of impediment, but later Stoics adopted it.)\n\n35Reed (2002b, 167–80) defends an alternative account on which (a) early Stoics were indirect\nrealists, (b) Academics raised problems for the view, which (c) later Stoics tried to meet by adopting\na disjunctivist view. While I cannot discuss the account properly here, let me briefly indicate\nwhy I do not endorse it. First, the evidence for (a) only comes LS 40B, in which it is said that\nZeno took sensations to be a compound of impressions with an act of assent. Reed (2002b, 168)\ncomments that “in order to assent to the [impression], the subject must be aware of it”. But LS\n40B does not talk of assenting to an impression. Moreover, it describes impressions as “a sort\nof blow provided from outside”, which suggests an alteration of mind rather than an image we\nintrospect (Frede, 1999, 315). Second, Reed does not detail how Academic arguments threaten the\nindirect realist view. Suppose that, as Reed suggests, early Stoics took “cognitive impressions”\nto be images resembling what is, caused by what is. Academics point out that the same images\ncould be caused by other things. From that one should infer that our impressions could fail to be\ncognitive—and further down the line, that even the wise cannot in principle avoid error entirely.\nBut the conclusion drawn was that none of our impressions were cognitive (LS 40D). Why? Third,\nthe evidence for (c) comes from Chrysippus’ distinction between impressions, which are caused\nby an “impressor”, and figments, which are not (LS 53G): as in contemporary disjunctivist views,\nthere is no common factor between impressions and delusions (Reed, 2002b, 171). But nothing\nindicates that the distinction was thought to be relevant to the debate with Academics: on the\ncontrary, the discussion exclusively focus on the distinction between cognitive and non-cognitive\nimpressions. Fourth, neither of the two views ascribed to Stoics supports their claim that it is in\nprinciple possible to avoid assent to non-cognitive impressions entirely (LS 41G). The only view\n\n14\n\n\n"
