"\ntic on moral affairs. Second, Buridan grants that God could make any sense-\nimpression false but allows knowledge on the basis of “evidentness” that en-\ntails the truth conditional on nature following its course.84 Now if Buridan takes\nnatural necessity to entail truth, that is a variant of Classical Infallibilism with\na restricted notion of necessity. If, however, natural necessity does not entail\ntruth—because miracles happen—then he is indeed rejecting Classical Infalli-\nbilism. One could even argue that he endorses a version of the Justified True\nBelief analysis.85 Note, however, that even on that reading Buridan’s view is\nclose to Dogmatic Classical Infallibilism. For he appears to think that, super-\nnatural scenarios aside, it is always possible to tell on reflection whether one’s\nsenses are deceived.86\n\nReid is commonly taken to defend a “fallibilist” conception of knowledge,\nfor he allows knowledge of external objects through perception unaided by rea-\nson even while recognising that perception is fallible.87 A detailed discussion\nof Reid is more than I can offer here. But I would like to stress three points that\nare crucial in assessing whether Reid is a counterexample to the New Story.\nFirst, we should distinguish source infallibilism from Classical Infallibilism. Our\nparadigm Infallibilists, Stoics, were “fallibilists” in a sense: unlike Epicurus,\n\ninsists that when he sees Socrates running, it is correct to say that he knows, and not merely opines,\nthat Socrates is running (Summulae de Dialectica, bk. 8, ch. 4, sec. 4, Klima, 2007, 149). Moreover, he\nstresses a sharp difference between knowledge and opinion: the former requires truth, the second\ndoes not. Since he took the “moral” kind of evidentness to be compatible with falsehood, the issue\nwhether it could yield something properly called “knowledge” would have been worth raising. I\nsuspect he did not do so because he thought the answer was obviously negative.\n\n84Summulae de Dialectica, bk. 8, ch. 4, sec. 4: “Another [type of evidentness] is such that in ac-\ncordance with it the cognitive power is compelled either by its own nature [or by some evident\nargument] to assent to a truth or a true proposition that cannot be falsified naturally, although it\ncould be falsified supernaturally. And this is what is required for natural science.” (Klima, 2007,\n149). The context indicates that “cannot be falsified naturally” here qualifies the assent, not merely\nthe proposition. (Previous paragraphs apply the supernaturally vs. naturally falsifiable distinction\nto “certainty on the part of the proposition”, i.e. truth and necessity; this paragraph analogously\nextend the distinction to “evidentness”. See Klima, 2009, 244 who reads the passage as concerning\nthe reliability of our cognitive faculties.)\n\n85To see this we need to unpack Buridan’s idiosyncratic terminology. He takes “certainty” to\ninvolve two things, one on the side of the proposition, one one the side of the subject. The former\nis said to be “firmness of truth” (metaphysical or natural necessity) in Quaestiones in Aristotelis\nMetaphysicam, Bk. 2 q. 1 (Klima, 2007, 145) but simply “truth” in the Summulae de Dialectica, bk. 8,\nch. 4, sec. 4 (Klima, 2007, 147). The latter is “firmness of assent”, which we would call subjective\ncertainty. Firm assent further divides into that without “evidentness” (orthodox faith, the wilful\nerrors of heretics, belief based on sophisms) and that “with evidentness”. Now in Summulae de\nDialectica, ibid., Buridan defines knowledge as “assent with certainty and evidentness” (Klima,\n2007, 146). Given the foregoing that is equivalent to: firm assent (i.e., belief) that is true and with\nevidentness. If evidentness is discernible but does not entail truth that is a version of the Justified\nTrue Belief view. See Karger (2010, 221–3) for a comparable reading.\n\n86“In response to [the argument about the deceptiveness of the senses] I say that if the senses are\nnaturally deceived, then the intellect has to investigate whether there are people there or not, and\nit has to correct the judgements of illusion” (Questions on Metaphysics, Bk. 2 q. 1, Klima, 2007, 146).\nSee however Zupko (1993, 210) for a weaker reading of Buridan’s claim that the intellect has the\npower to correct the error of the senses.\n\n87Greco (1995, 294). However, Sosa (2009, 61) takes some of Reid’s principles to be infallibilist.\nHe takes them to be false and discusses a revised, fallibilist reading of Reid’s view.\n\n28\n\n\n"
