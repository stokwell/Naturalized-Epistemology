"\nAs the definition makes clear, nothing special is meant by “mark” and\n“bearing a mark”. A mark is simply a property of beliefs; a belief “bears” a\nmark if it has the property. For instance, the truth of a belief is (trivially) a mark\nof truth. But it is not discernible, since even an attentive subject may believe\nthat one of her beliefs is true while it is not. By contrast, having the content that\nit rains seems to be a discernible mark: a sufficiently attentive subject will be-\nlieve that a belief of hers has the content that it rains if and only if it has.13 But\nthat is not a mark of truth, since some beliefs that have that content are false.\nDescartes’s “clarity and distinction” is a prototypical example of a putative\ndiscernible mark of truth: on his view, only true beliefs can have a “clear and\ndistinct” content and a sufficiently attentive subject will believe that a belief\nhas a clear and distinct content if and only if it has.14\n\nIf Infallibilism were put forward today several issues of detail would need\nto be addressed. First, the definition of marks of truth is too permissive. The\nproperty of having the content that 331 is prime is one that only true beliefs have.\nIt may also be discernible. Yet somebody may believe that 331 is prime with-\nout thereby knowing that it is. To avoid that, we should say that a property is\na mark of truth if it belongs to a relevant kind of properties that all entail truths.\nHaving the content that 331 is prime is of a kind that includes having the content\nthat 333 is prime, which is not truth-entailing. Second, a similar refinement is\nneeded for discernibility. There may be some brain pattern C such that neces-\nsarily, one believes that one’s belief is realised by C just if it is. But we do not\nwant being realized by C to count as a discernible property. Again, we should\nsay that a mark is discernible only if marks of its kinds are such that atten-\ntive subjects discern them. What kinds count as “relevant”? We may leave it\nopen. Note that the shift to kinds makes Infallibilism more stringent, so it does\nnot threaten the main claim I will make: that Infallibilism leads to Scepticism.\nThird, we should specify whether our notion of necessity is restricted, say, to\nphysical possibility. Fourth, we should clarify sufficient attention. It is implic-\nitly relative to a belief: a mark of a belief is discernible if it is discerned by a\nsubject attentive enough to that belief. We need not assume that subjects directly\nrefer to their belief; it is enough for them to think of it under a description such\nas “my belief that 331 is prime”. The definition does not prevent the beliefs\nof an unreflective creature from bearing discernible marks provided sufficiently\nattentive versions of that creature would be able to reflect on their own beliefs.\n\n13Or so it seems. Williamson´s (2000, chap. 4) anti-luminosity argument can be adapted to\nargue that there must be cases where even a sufficiently attentive subject could be mistaken about\nwhether a belief of hers has the content that it rains; and more generally, to argue that nothing is\ndiscernible. However, that is a surprising—and still controversial—result, and it is a fair bet that it\nwould have come as a surprise to past philosophers too.\n\n14See section 4.\n\n7\n\n\n"
