Briefly put: classical Indian philosophers shared the\n\nview that knowledge is thought (“cognition”, but in a non-truth-entailing sense) generated by\na “knowledge-source” (pramāna. ), where the latter is truth-entailing. A central debate was whether\nand how pramāna. -generated thoughts are “certified” to be such. On one possible reading, they\ntacitly assumed that being pramāna. -generated had to be discernible in order to yield knowledge,\nand the debate was about whether and how it was discernible. Note that the Classical Infallibilist\nreading of early Indian epistemology is incompatible with the presentation given by Stoltz (2007,\n401–6). Stoltz stresses that Indian philosophers took knowledge to be a factive mental state and\nendorsed something like a causal theory of knowledge. So far that is consistent with the Classical\nInfallibilist’s truth-entailment requirement. But he adds that on their view knowledge is not lumi-\nnous and knowing can be phenomenally like being mistaken (405–6). These claims are incompat-\nible with the Classical Infallibilist’s requirement of a discernible truth-entailing property. However\nStoltz appears to ascribe them to classical Indian philosophers only because they take knowledge\nto be a mental state and they endorse a causal theory. But we have seen that Descartes endorses\nthe discernibility requirement even though he takes clear and distinct perception to be a factive\nmental states and we have seen that Stoics endorse a discernibility requirement even though they\nhave a causal theory of cognitive impression.
