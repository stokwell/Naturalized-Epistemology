"\n4.2 Easy cases: Descartes and Locke\n\nDescartes is routinely presented as if his Meditations were meant to establish\nknowledge of the external world.47 If so, Descartes takes himself to be the\nfirst man to discover that there are trees—or at the very least, the first one\nto discover that we know that there are trees. I find it hard to read him that\nway. Descartes is better understood by taking seriously his distinction be-\ntween “cognition” (cognitio) and “science” (scientia).48 What he takes himself\nto pioneer is a new science for metaphysics and other domains of theoretical\nenquiry.49 Doing so requires pretending that we have no cognition of what can\nbe doubted and overcoming these doubts in an orderly manner. Cognition,\non the other hand, consists in a “clear and distinct perception” that something\nis so.50 Descartes claims that clear and distinct perception entails truth.51 He\nevidently thinks that, if we are attentive enough, we will believe that we have\na clear and distinction perception just if we have one. So clear and distinct\nperception is a discernible mark of truth. And that is all that cognition—as\n\nby drastically restricting their content puts a heavy load on “preconceptions” or inferences from\nsense-impressions. In Augustine’s view these were supplied by God. Divine illumination theories\ndominated the early Middle Ages from Augustine through al-Ghazālı̄ (1058–1111 CE, Kukkonen,\n2010) up to Henry of Ghent (c. 1217–1293 CE). A recurrent idea is that without divine illumination\nwe would not know much. I submit that divine illumination was taken to be necessary for there\nto be discernible marks of truth. (3) The late medieval debate over scepticism. Henry of Ghent’s dis-\ncussion of Academics sparked an intense debate that lasted until the arrival of the Black Death in\nthe mid-fourteenth. The debate was fueled by a wider conception of the possible, as most philoso-\nphers agreed that God’s omnipotence was not constrained by regularities of nature. Nevertheless\na first wave of philosophers defended what appears to be Classical Infallibilist answers on which,\nroughly, intellect is in principle always in position to correct the senses: see e.g. Perler, 2010, 387\nand Grellard (2004, 132–3) on John Duns Scotus (c. 1265–1308) and Karger (2004) on William of\nOckham (c. 1287–1347; but see Pannaccio and Piché, 2010 for a fallibilist reading). However a sec-\nond wave put forward answers that seem to reject Classical Infallibilism We return to the two most\nprominent examples below (sec. 4.7).\n\n47See e.g. Williams (2005, 15, 19-20), for whom Descartes aims at showing how knowledge is\npossible and at devising a method for acquiring it.\n\n48In the Second Replies: “However, I do not deny that an atheist could know [cognoscere] clearly\nthat the three angles of a triangle are equal to two right angles; I am simply affirming that his\nknowledge [cognitionem] is not true scientific knowledge [scientiam], since no knowledge [cognitio]\nthat can be rendered doubtful seems to deserve to be called scientific knowledge [scientia].” (AT\nVII:141, trans. Ariew and Cress in Descartes, 2006, 83). Cottingham (Descartes, 1984, 101) translates\ncognitio as “awareness” and scientia as “knowledge”. DeRose (1992b), Sosa (1997) and Carriero\n(2007) argue that the distinction between cognitio and scientia is crucial to Descartes’s avoidance of\ncircularity in the Meditations.\n\n49See Frankfurt (1970, chap. 2), Wolterstorff (1996, 180–218), Pasnau (2013, 1000–1). The stated\ngoal of Descartes’s meditator is “to establish [something] in the sciences” (First Meditation, AT\nVII:17). Descartes writes to Mersenne: “These six Meditations contain all the foundations of my\nphysics.” (January 28, 1641, AT III:298). Some texts (notably the Regulae) suggest that Descartes\nthought that the scientific ideal was achieved in mathematics. But the passage of the Second Replies\nquoted above suggests that even mathematics fall short.\n\n50“In this first item of knowledge [cognitione] there is simply a clear and distinct perception of\nwhat I am asserting” (Third Meditation, AT VII:35, Descartes, 1984, 24). Carriero (2007, 306–7) takes\nthis passage to state what cognition involves in general.\n\n51“So I now seem to be able to lay it down as a general rule that whatever I perceive very dearly\nand distinctly is true” (AT VII:35, Descartes, 1984, 24).\n\n18\n\n\n"
