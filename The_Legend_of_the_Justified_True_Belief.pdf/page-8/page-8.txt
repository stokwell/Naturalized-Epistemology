"\nMore generally, being sufficiently attentive involves an idealised version of the\nsubject. The more generous the idealisation, the more permissive discernibility\nis. Some recherché cases may cause further trouble but we need not get into\nthem.15 Sixth, a basing condition is missing. A belief’s having the content that\none is in pain and being held by a person in pain is a mark of truth and one may\nthink it is discernible. Yet a person in pain who believes that they are in pain\nonly because their crystal ball says so does not know that they are in pain.\nThe account should require that the belief be somehow based on its bearing a\ndiscernible mark of truth.16 One option is to introduce a separate basing con-\ndition. Another is to restrict our choice of marks to properties of the kind being\nbased on thus-and-so. The second is more stringent as it requires basing facts\nthemselves to be discernible.\n\nUntil recently philosophers hardly ever raised such issues. Sometimes we\ncan argue that they implicitly adopted some answer or that their views com-\nmitted them to one. But it is often pointless to ask what their answer would\nhave been.\n\nDiscernibility is akin to two notions in the recent epistemology literature:\nluminosity and cognitive access. Some epistemologists talk of what is “cogni-\ntively accessible” to a subject. That is sometimes glossed as facts the subject\nis “capable of becoming aware of” (BonJour, 2010, 364) or as facts she is ca-\npable of becoming aware of “upon reflection” (Chisholm, 1977, 16–7). On an\nordinary reading of these phrases, I am aware that it is daylight now and I\nam capable of becoming aware upon reflection that I ate some bread yester-\nday. That is not, however, the way these epistemologists use these phrases.\nTheir guiding intuition is that facts one has “access” to are just those facts that\none would still know if one were in some Cartesian Demon scenario. But they\ndo not define the notion that way; rather, it is supposed to follow from some\nnatural notion of “access” that what we have access to withstands Descartes’s\nDemon. I suggest that the notion of discernible fact is the one they have in\nmind.17 Williamson (2000, 95) calls a condition—something a subject is in at\n\n15For instance, if necessarily, sufficiently attentive subjects believe that they are attentive, then\nbeing an unattended-to belief turns out to be trivially discernible. It is unclear that the result is bad.\nIf it is, we may say that discernibility requires the antecedent to be non-trivially satisfied.\n\n16It may seem paradoxical to say that a belief could based on some its own features. To see that\nis not, consider a parallel with action. I may run from A to B because that is a way of reaching B, or\nbecause that is a way to exercise. We may then say that my undertaking the action was based on the\naction having these features. Similarly I may form a belief on the basis of certain features it would\nhave if formed.\n\n17Contrast Fumerton’s (2006, 53) suggestion that the intended notion of “access” is access by\nintrospection. Introspection is supposed to be a reflective way of find out about one’s own inter-\nnal mental states. Thus while in an ordinary sense of “reflection”, one can find out by reflection\nwhether one has eaten bread yesterday (an external fact), whether one’s heart is beating (a inter-\nnal, non-mental fact) or whether one saw a cat yesterday (a non-internal mental state), these are\nnot instances of introspection, because the subject-matter of introspection is restricted to internal\nmental states. But if introspection plays a special epistemological role, it cannot be merely because\n\n8\n\n\n"
