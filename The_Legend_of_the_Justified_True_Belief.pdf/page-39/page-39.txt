"\nwe have such marks. For instance, they may think that our evidence consists\nin discernible aspects of our experience. If these philosophers dispense with\na notion of knowledge entirely, their view is essentially a notational variant of\nProbabilist Scepticism, with “evidence” in lieu of “knowledge”. Most often,\nthey endorse a looser standard for knowledge; their view is a variant of Inter-\nnalist Infallibilism. Note that the contemporary rise of the notion of evidence\nis partly due to the Bayesian tradition. If, as I suspect, the tradition has roots\nin Classical Infallibilism, it is not surprising that its notion of evidence has a\nClassical Infallibilist flavour.125\n\n6 Conclusion\n\nThe New Story is simple but surprisingly powerful. It makes sense of a range\nof features of the history of epistemology. Historical views are hard to place\non the contemporary map and conversely because the latter reject the former’s\nconception of knowledge. Scepticism was influential in the past, but not now,\nbecause past views lead to it and contemporary ones do not. Past philoso-\nphers did not discuss the definition of knowledge because they did not dis-\nagree about it. Idealism was predominant for a couple of centuries because it\nwas a desperate attempt to rescue Dogmatism within the bounds of Classical\nInfallibilism. It disappeared almost entirely afterwards because it had lost its\npurpose. The Gettier problem appeared in the mid-twentieth century because\nviews clearly subject to it did not exist before. Contemporary epistemology\ndivides into Externalism and Internalism because they are the two main ways\nof giving up the traditional view. Contemporary epistemology has two central\nnotions, justification and knowledge, because each is felt to capture one side of\nthe traditional view: discernibility and truth-entailment. Internalist notions of\nevidence gained popularity in the contemporary period because they offered\na new home for Classical Infallibilist intuitions. Needless to say, no remotely\ncomparable explanatory success can be adduced for the Legend.\n\nEpistemologists may draw a few lessons from the New Story. First: we are\nall Infallibilists now.126 Post-Gettier and Classical views alike put a substantial\ntruth-entailing condition on knowledge. What sets contemporary views apart\nis not to require that the condition should be discernible.127 If it where, there\n\n125See in particular Jeffrey (1965; 1992), whose epistemological project is to strip the Bayesian\nconception of evidence of its infallibilist roots.\n\n126See Sturgeon (1993).\n127Contrast with Cohen (1988) and Reed (2002a) who characterize “fallibilism” as the view that\n\nsome beliefs with non-truth-entailing evidence (Cohen) or with non-knowledge-entailing justifi-\ncation (Reed) constitute knowledge. They suggest that “infallibilism” has sceptical implications,\nbut that is so only if evidence and justification are constrained in certain ways. If one’s evidence\nis everything one knows, and if the only justification for believing p is that you know that p, “in-\n\n39\n\n\n"
