Socrates, Plato and Aristotle mostly discussed expert knowledge: ge-\nometry, astronomy, medicine, politics, philosophy and so on—what we may\nnow call theoretical disciplines or sciences.21 Their Hellenistic successors were\nsquarely interested in ordinary knowledge: knowing that something is sweet,\nthat something is a dog, that someone is your child (LS 39C, 40H). The shift\nwas so significant that Brunschwig (1999) calls it an “epistemological turn”.22\n\nThe founders of two new schools, Epicurus (341-271) and Zeno of Citium (334-\n262), argued that there were “criteria of truth”, yardsticks with which opin-\nions could be tested for knowledge.

For\nthe next two centuries, Greek epistemology was dominated by the sharp and\nsustained debate between the Stoa of Zeno and Chrysippus (head 232-c.206)\nand the ‘New Academy’ of Arcesilaus and Carneades (head from mid-second\ncentury BCE to 137).

See Vlastos (1985) for further discussion. For Aristotle, see\nBurnyeat (1981), Irwin (1988, 118), Barnes (1993, 82), Pasnau (2013, 991–3); though see Irwin (2010)\nfor a more guarded view.
