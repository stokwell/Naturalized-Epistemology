"\nand 5.3\n\n1 The Legend and its puzzles\n\nThe Legend is the claim that “Edmund Gettier’s landmark paper successfully\nrefuted the traditional analysis of knowledge” (Sosa et al., 2009, 189). The claim\nfigures in almost every contemporary handbook.4 It has two components: the\nJustified True Belief analysis was the traditional one, and Gettier refuted it.\nThey cannot both be true. As Gettier (1963) stresses, his counterexamples as-\nsume that justification does not entail truth.5 But, as I will argue at length\nbelow, insofar as we can identify justification conditions on knowledge in tra-\nditional views, they are truth-entailing. Thus traditional views are not the ones\nGettier refuted. Be that as it may, it is worth listing a few facts that would be\npuzzling if the Legend was true.\n\nWhy is it so hard to find statements of the analysis before the mid-twentieth cen-\ntury? Plato, Kant and Russell are usually cited.6 But that is it. I am not aware\nof any other putative statement in the Western tradition. If there was one it\nwould have been widely reported by now. So what about Aristotle, Epicurus,\nthe Stoics, the Sceptics, Thomas, Ockham, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke,\nBerkeley, Hume, Reid or Kant, to name a few?\n\nWhy did nobody notice Gettier-style cases? The Theaetetus is one of the most\nwidely read philosophical texts in history. It ends with the suggestion that a\ntrue belief with an “account” is not sufficient for knowledge. So, if the Leg-\nend is correct, it raises the question whether justified true belief is sufficient for\nknowledge. But somehow nobody noticed counterexamples before the twen-\ntieth century.
