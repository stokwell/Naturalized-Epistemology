"\nideal-theoretic epistemology makes sceptical worries much less pressing than\nknowledge-centred epistemology does. Thus his picture makes it puzzling that\nsceptical views were taken much more seriously in history than they are now.92\n\nThe New Story, by contrast, explains it by ascribing historical philosophers a\nview that does lead to scepticism. Second, the picture omits the fact that the\nepistemic ideal was typically defined in terms of knowledge. Aristotle defines sci-\nence (or understanding, epistēmē) as knowledge (gignōskein) of why something\nis so and could not be otherwise than it is.93 Stoics define science (epistēmē)\nas body of knowledge (cognition, katalēpsis) rich enough to withstand objec-\ntions. Descartes defines science (scientia) in terms of clear and distinct percep-\ntion, which is his account of (basic) knowledge (cognitio).94 Far from defining\nthe ordinary notion of knowledge as a lesser form of the epistemic ideal, these\nphilosophers defined the epistemic ideal in terms of knowledge. Third, it omits\nthe fact that many historical philosophers had a theory of knowledge. We have\nseen that the Stoics had one and we have reviewed evidence for a similar the-\nory across history. Granted, Pasnau is right that there was little discussion of\nwhat knowledge is—especially in comparison to how much they debated the\nproper form and method of science and whether we knew anything.
