"\nthey granted that senses are fallible. Thus like Reid, they “did not require that\nsources of knowledge be infallible” (Greco, 1995, 294). But they were Classical\nInfallibilists, because they thought that these sources provide us with knowl-\nedge only when they provide us with a discernible mark of truth. Thus we\nshould ask whether Reid thought it possible for a belief to constitute knowl-\nedge without any of its discernible features entailing its truth. Second, as with\nthe Stoics, it is important to recall that discernibility does not require that one\ncan introspect one’s impressions; it merely requires that a sufficiently attentive\nsubject believes that they have an impression of the right kind just when they\ndo.88 Thus Reid may both reject the Lockean Doctrine of Ideas and yet take\nsense-impressions to be discernible. Third, as with Mill and Buridan, it is cru-\ncial to ask whether Reid is operating with a restricted notion of necessity. He\nmay merely be requiring that given laws of nature, suitable sense-impressions\nentail their truth.\n\nAn indisputable counterexample to the hypothesis is Ramsey (1931). Ram-\nsey takes inductive inference to be a source of knowledge and he clearly ac-\nknowledges that it is not truth-preserving but merely “reliable”, that is, it only\nleads to true opinion “on the whole”. There is no indication that, like Mill, he\ntakes some discernible subclass of inductive inferences to be truth-preserving.\nHence he rejects Classical Infallibilism. Significantly, however, Ramsey’s bril-\nliant anticipation had little influence in its time.\n\n4.8 Alternatives to the New Story\n\nTwo other broad pictures of the history of epistemology have been recently\ndefended. Antognazza (2015, 167–71) also argues that the Justified True Be-\nlief analysis is a twentieth century invention and that there is nevertheless a\ntraditional conception of knowledge. On her view the tradition takes knowl-\nedge to be “a primitive perception or an irreducible mental ‘seeing’ what is the\ncase; [. . . ] a primitive presence of a fact to the mind (or to the senses) in which\nthere is no ‘gap’ between knower and known” (169). The state in question is\nincompatible with, and irreducible to, belief. But it involves “thinking with\nassent” (assent, for short), a genus of which knowledge and belief are species.\nSince presence of the fact that p entails that p is so, being made in presence of\nthe fact to the mind is a truth-entailing property of assents. So as in the New\nStory, tradition says that knowing entails being in some acceptance-like state\nwith a truth-entailing property. Her picture differs on three counts, however.\nFirst, the acceptance-like state is assent rather than belief. It is not clear to me\n\n88See fns. 33 and 39 above.\n\n29\n\n\n"
