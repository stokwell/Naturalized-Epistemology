"\nimpressions were taken to be discernible marks at least of their own presence.\nThus if ordinary objects—trees, horses and the like—were made out of impres-\nsions, then perhaps we had discernible mark of truths for our ordinary beliefs\nafter all. Thus the epistemological troubles of Classical Infallibilism motivated\nthe revisionary metaphysics of Idealism.\n\nLocke flirted with Idealism in his reply to scepticism. In case his main an-\nswer was not granted he proposed an alternative. Even if what he calls “fire”\nturns out to be an idea in him, it is no less a cause (or temporal predecessor)\nof pain, and knowing that is all that matters.63 The assumption is that even if\nhe lacks discernible marks of truth about the existence of fire, he has at least\ndiscernible marks of truths for the existence of sensations of fire and what fol-\nlows from them. For—his thought may be—the sensations play the role of\ndiscernible marks of their own presence. The further step, taken by Berkeley\nand subsequent Idealists, was to claim that “fire” in fact refers to these sensa-\ntions.64 Thus we may hope to have discernible marks of the presence of fire\nafter all.\n\nThe Classical Infallibilist motivation is evident in Berkeley and Kant. Berke-\nley grants the sceptical claim that we have no discernible mark of truths for the\nexistence of unperceived bodies.65 In line with Classical Infallibilism, he con-\ncludes that we do not know that there are such things. He claims, however,\nthat we do know our ideas and what they necessary entail.66 He avoids out-\nright scepticism by claiming that ordinary things like apples are collections of\nideas.67\n\nKant’s “refutation of Idealism” (B274–9) is meant to show that the existence\n63Locke (1975, IV, 2, §14): “But yet if [one who argues that a dream may produce the same idea]\n\nbe resolved to appear so sceptical as to maintain, that what I call being actually in the fire is nothing\nbut a dream; and that we cannot thereby certainly know, that any such thing as fire actually exists\nwithout us: I answer, That we certainly finding that pleasure or pain follows upon the application\nof certain objects to us, whose existence we perceive, or dream that we perceive, by our senses; this\ncertainty is as great as our happiness or misery, beyond which we have no concernment to know\nor to be.” The reply is pragmatic rather than Idealist.\n\n64See Berkeley ( 57, §1) “Thus, for example a certain colour, taste, smell, figure and consistence\nhaving been observed to go together, are accounted one distinct thing, signified by the name apple.\nOther collections of ideas constitute a stone, a tree, a book, and the like sensible things–which as\nthey are pleasing or disagreeable excite the passions of love, hatred, joy, grief, and so forth.”\n\n65Berkeley ( 57, §18): “But what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without\nthe mind, from what we perceive, since the very patrons of Matter themselves do not pretend\nthere is any necessary connexion betwixt them and our ideas? I say it is granted on all hands (and what\nhappens in dreams, phrensies, and the like, puts it beyond dispute) that it is possible we might be\naffected with all the ideas we have now, though there were no bodies existing without resembling them”.\n\n66See Berkeley ( 57, §18): “Either we must know [the existence of unperceived bodies] by sense or\nby reason. As for our senses, by them we have the knowledge ONLY OF OUR SENSATIONS, ideas,\nor those things that are immediately perceived by sense, call them what you will: but they do not\ninform us that things exist without the mind, or unperceived, like to those which are perceived.”\nThe rest of the paragraph, quoted above, shows that Berkeley assumes that something is known\nby reason only if it is entailed by the existence of our ideas. Berkeley takes this to include the\nimmortality of souls, the existence of other minds and the existence of God.\n\n67See e.g. Berkeley ( 57, §1), quoted fn. 64 above.\n\n22\n\n\n"
