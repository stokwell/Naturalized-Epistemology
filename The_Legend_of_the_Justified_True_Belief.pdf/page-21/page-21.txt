"\ncalls a ground “objectively sufficient” only if it is truth-entailing.60 Kant’s def-\ninition would otherwise fail to secure the claim that knowledge entails truth.61\n\nNothing more is required.62 Thus it is at least open whether Kant’s view is an\ninstance of Classical Infallibilism. As we see below, the reading also fits well\nwith Kant’s treatment of external-world scepticism.\n\n4.4 Idealist Dogmatism\n\nA striking feature of Western philosophy from the eighteenth to mid-twentieth\ncentury is the predominance of Idealist views. What the New Story suggests\nis that Idealism was an attempt to rescue Dogmatism in a Classical Infallibilist\nframework. For a variety of reasons, sceptical arguments came to the fore again\nin modern times. Philosophers increasingly doubted that there were any dis-\ncernible class of true sense-impressions. The natural conclusion for Classical\nInfallibilists is Scepticism—and many embraced it, as we will see. However,\n\n60Chignell (2007b, 42) denies it. He takes objective sufficiency to consist in sufficiently high ob-\njective probability. That clashes with Kant’s definition of probability as “assent based on insuf-\nficient grounds” (AA 9:80, Kant, 1992, 583). As Chignell (2007b, 60n19, 61n31) concedes, Kant\nnormally associates sufficient grounds with “certainty”. So Chignell should rather say that Kant’s\n“certainty” is not truth-entailing. However, Kant distinguishes “I am certain” from “the object is\ncertain” and uses the latter for objectively sufficient grounds (A822/B850, AA 9:72). While the\npersonal construction is compatible with falsehood, the impersonal one is not: “it is not raining\nand it is certain that it rains” is contradictory. If Kant departed from ordinary and philosophical\nusage so much as to call objectively “certain” things that are false it is surprising that he never\nmentioned it. Now Chignell’s (2007b, 42) claim that Kant’s objectively sufficient grounds are not\ntruth-entailing rests on two passages of Kant’s lectures on logic in which it is said that when one’s\ngrounds are objectively sufficient, there may still be grounds for the opposite (AA 9:72, Kant, 1992,\n576; AA 24:160, Kant, 1992, 126). But the fact that sufficient grounds may coexist with grounds\nfor the opposite does not entail that there are sufficient objective grounds for false claims. Like\nDescartes, Kant may have thought that having a discernible mark of truth for something is com-\npatible with having (insufficient) grounds for doubting it. Note in particular that a ground’s being\ntruth-entailing and discernible does not entail that it is discernible or antecedently known that the\nground is truth-entailing. Thus a subject with objectively sufficient grounds may doubt that they\nare objectively sufficient. A further discussion of these issues would require a close examination\nof Kant’s discussion of doubt, how it is removed, and how to ascertain whether one’s grounds of\nassent are objective or subjective (e.g. AA: 9:83, 9:73). For present purposes it is enough to show\nthat a Classical Infallibilist reading of Kant is a live option.\n\n61Thus Chignell (2007a, 330), denying that objective sufficiency is truth-entailing, supplements\nthe definition with a truth clause and suggests that Kant, “operating in the Platonic tradition”,\nhas left it implicit. The New Story casts doubt on the existence of such a tradition. While in\nthe Critique Kant is admittedly brief on knowledge and related concepts (“I will not pause for\nthe exposition of such readily grasped concepts”, A822/B850), it is worth noting that his much\nmore detailed lectures on logic give the very same definition, without truth clause (quoted above).\nEarlier lectures (Blomberg’s notes) give the following instead: “To know is to judge something\nand hold it to be true with certainty.” (AA 24:148). Again, no truth clause is added. The textbook\nKant was relying on (G.F. Meier’s Excerpt from the Doctrine of Reason, §§155-167) does not does not\nprovide the alleged implicit clause either—it does not define Wissen at all. If so it would be peculiar\nfor Kant to leave his students in the dark about it.\n\n62In particular, as Chignell (2007b, 49) stresses, “some of the facts on which an assent’s objective\nsufficiency supervenes—and in particular facts about its objective probability—will typically be\ninaccessible to a normal subject.” Knowledge requires an objectively sufficient ground, not that\nit be discernible or antecedently known that that ground is objectively sufficient. That fits with\nthe Classical Infallibilist picture, on which knowledge requires discernible marks that are in fact\ntruth-entailing, not that one discerns or antecedently knows that the marks are truth-entailing.\n\n21\n\n\n"
