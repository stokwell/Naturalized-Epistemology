"\nCarneades’s convincing is of course not the modern quantified notion of\nprobability. But its core features are those later philosophers commonly asso-\nciate with epistemic notions of the “probable”. First, it somehow invites assent:\nit makes something “appear true”. Second, it is discernible. On Carneades’s\nview the two are conjoined: the convincing is discernible because it is a certain\nway of appearing true. Third, it is not truth-entailing but it is reliable. Fourth,\nit comes in degrees. These features can be found in later notions of “probabil-\nity”, sometimes—but not always—spelled out in terms of mathematical prob-\nability.73 Thus “Probabilism” is not a wholly bad name for a view inspired by\nCarneades.74 The same features may be found in the contemporary internal-\nist notion of (epistemic) “justification”, when that term is used to denote not\nsimply the normative status of being justified but some discernible indication of\ntruth in virtue of which a belief has that status (“one’s reasons”, “grounds” or\n“evidence”).\n\nPhilosophers who adopt Carneades’s “criterion” may emphatically deny\nthat they are Sceptics because they deny that we ought to suspend judgement.\nBut they are Sceptics in the sense of denying that we know. Locke is a prime\nexample. He distinguishes the certain, which is the province of knowledge,\nfrom the merely probable, which falls short of knowledge.75 The scope of the\nformer is severely limited: ideas and conceptual truths, the existence of God\nand the existence of particular things that we currently perceive.76 In the latter,\nhowever, opinion is allowed. As with Carneades, “probability” is defined in\nterms of discernible indication of truth—though Locke hesitates on whether\nthe indication’s reliability should be real or apparent.77 Probabilist Scepticism\nis also manifest in the first philosophers to call themselves “fallibilists”, namely\n\nto show that lack of knowledge did not entail that no action was justified (Long and Sedley, 448–9\nand Schofield, 1999, 334–8). At any rate, it is clear enough that Philo did relax Academic Scepticism\nenough to allow the formation of “probable” opinions.
