"\nPierce and Popper.78\n\n4.6 Induction and Infallibilism\n\nSurely, one may think, historical philosophers were aware that most ordinary\nbeliefs are based on inductive inference. So, if Classical Infallibilism is true,\nthen historical philosophers must have been either widely sceptical or strangely\nconvinced that inductive inference was infallible. But both seem absurd.\n\nAs surprising as it may seem to contemporary epistemologists, that is ex-\nactly what we find. Many philosophers had an extremely restricted view of\nwhat we know, excluding e.g. knowledge of the future, or knowledge acquired\nby testimony, or almost all perceptual knowledge. Locke is a case in point.\nOthers had infallibilist views about inductive inference. I think that could be\nargued about Ancient and Medieval accounts of inductive inference in terms of\nthe acquisition of “pre-notions” (either by observation or divine illumination).\nBut I will simply mention one striking modern instance. In his System of Logic,\nBook 3, Mill aims at giving conditions for “correct” induction. He writes:\n\n“Some [inductions], we know, which were believed for centuries\nto be correct, were nevertheless incorrect. That all swans are white,\ncannot have been a good induction, since the conclusion has turned\nout erroneous.”\n\nBy contraposition, if an induction is “good”, its conclusion is not erroneous.\nUndoubtedly, Mill thought that the validity of induction depended on an ob-\njective, substantial feature of our world: its “uniformity”. And unlike Kant,\nit did not think that the uniformity of the world was somehow demonstrable.\nBut he appeared to think that, given that uniformity, some inductive methods\nare truth-entailing.\n\n78Peirce introduced the term “fallibilism” and defined it as the doctrine “that we can never be\nsure of anything” or “that we cannot attain absolute certainty concerning matters of fact” (Peirce,\n1950, 58–9). He took that to involve the rejection of the aim of knowledge: “there will remain over\nno relic of the good old tenth-century infallibilism, except that of the infallible scientists, under\nwhich head I include [. . . ] all those respectable and cultivated persons who, having acquired\ntheir notions of science from reading, and not from research, have the idea that “science” means\nknowledge, while the truth is, it is a misnomer applied to the pursuit of those who are devoured\nby a desire to find things out” (Peirce, 1950, 3). Popper (1972, 228) calls himself “fallibilist” as\nwell. He does talk about “scientific knowledge”, which he claims to be in continuity with ordinary\nknowledge and to be the object of traditional epistemology—Plato, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Mill\nand Russell (Popper, 1959/2002, xxi–ii). However, he allows “knowledge” to be falsified, hence\nfalse. Whether or not that is a legitimate extension of “know”, it is closer to Carneades’s notion of\nprobable opinion than to historical and contemporary notions of knowledge.\n\n26\n\n\n"
