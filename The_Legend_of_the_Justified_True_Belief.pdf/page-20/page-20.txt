"\n“Account” is usually glossed as an “explanation of why something is so”. In-\nsofar as one cannot explain why something is so without it being so, accounts\nare truth-entailing.56 It is open whether Plato took having an account to be\ndiscernible.57 Thus it is open whether Plato’s view is an instance of Classical\nInfallibilism.\n\nKant defines knowledge as “assent [that] is both subjectively and objec-\ntively sufficient”.58 That is spelled out in Kant’s lectures on logic as “assent\nbased on a ground of cognition that is objectively as well as subjectively suf-\nficient” (AA 9:70, Kant, 1992, 574). One may argue that Kant calls a ground\n“subjectively sufficient” just if it is discernible.59 One may also argue that Kant\n\nof “account” that is unsatisfactory in the Theaetetus. See Fine (1979), Chappell (2009, sec 8) and\nBurnyeat (1990, 235–8) for some discussion. Fine (2004, 70–1) argues that Plato’s definition covers\nknowledge rather than understanding or science. It is also debated whether the definition covers\npropositional knowledge, objectual knowledge, or both: the sun, virtue and Theaetetus are given\nas examples of things known. White (1976, 176ff), Nehamas (1984) and Kaplan (1985, 352) object to\ncomparisons with the justified true belief analysis on that basis. See Fine (1979, 366–7; 2004, 48–9)\nfor a rejoinder.\n\n56Thanks to John Hawthorne here. Fine (2004, 67, 72) argues that Plato’s notion of “account” is\ndemanding and that “beliefs with an account” cannot be based on any falsehood, but she leaves\nopen whether some such beliefs are false.\n\n57Fine (2004, 66) tentatively suggests that Plato’s notion of account is internalist.\n58A822/B850, Kant (1998, 684). For simplicity I replace Guyer’s literal rendering of Fürwahrhal-\n\nten as “taking something to be true” by “assent” (as does Chignell, 2007b, 35). “Assent” is broader\nthan belief—it includes suppositions, for instance (Chignell, 2007a, 37). However, “subjectively\nsufficient” assent involves a degree of conviction that would make it count as belief by contem-\nporary standards. The word for “knowledge” here is Wissen. Most of the Critique of Pure Reason\nis concerned with Erkenntnis, which Guyer translates as “cognition”. In German Erkenntnis is a\n“knowledge”-like term: it derives from the verb for objectual knowledge (kennen) and typically\nmeans “recognition”, “realization” or “discovery”. Hence it is tempting to identify Kant’s Erken-\nntnis / Wissen pair with the traditional distinction between cognitio and scientia. Thus Kemp Smith\ntranslated Erkenntnis as “knowledge” (see also Dicker, 2004, xii). The temptation must be resisted,\nhowever. Kant’s Erkenntnis includes representations that are false (A58/B83) and ideas of reason,\nsuch as the immortality of the soul, that lie beyond what can be known (A3/B6, A320/B376-77).\nThus Erkenntnis is not plausibly understood as a notion of knowledge, ordinary or otherwise.\nRather, Kant seems to use it for any mental state that can be evaluated as true or false (or more\nbroadly, correct or incorrect) (A58/B83, A320/B376-77). Wissen is Kant’s notion of knowledge. So,\nsomewhat surprisingly, the primary object of Kant’s first Critique is not the possibility of knowl-\nedge but the possibility of thought. The switch from the epistemological to the semantic is char-\nacteristic of Idealist views. Note that Kant does have a knowledge / science pair: Wissen / Wis-\nsenschaft (distinguished at A832/B860).\n\n59Chignell (2007b, 45) says that a ground of one’s assent is “subjectively sufficient” just if on re-\nflection, one would cite it as one’s sufficient objective ground. Thus if g is a subjectively sufficient\nground of your belief, then if you were attentive enough, you would believe that your belief is\nbased on g. This leaves open whether, if you were attentive enough and your belief was not based\non g, you could think that it was. But while Kant clearly thinks that the grounds of our judgement\nare not immediately transparent to us, he does seem to think that sufficient reflection would al-\nlow one to tell what they are (see e.g. AA 9:76, Kant, 1992, 579). Relatedly, Chignell (2007b, 41–2)\ndiscusses whether “grounds” are only internal psychological states or include external states as\nwell. There is textual evidence both ways. Interestingly for us, Chignell’s conclusion is that ex-\nternal facts could be included insofar as they are discernible: “[. . . ] in order to know something a\nsubject must be able to cite or pick out what she takes to be her objective grounds. As long as that\nis possible with respect to the relevant external states or objects, then perhaps we can allow them\nto count as objective grounds as well”. This chimes in with the New Story, according to which if\nClassical Infallibilists assign a special epistemological role to internal states, that is because they\nare discernible, not because they are internal (fn. 17 above).\n\n20\n\n\n"
