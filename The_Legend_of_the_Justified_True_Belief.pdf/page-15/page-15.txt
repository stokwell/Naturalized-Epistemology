"\nReed (2002b, 160) doubts that Stoics held the view that “false impressions\ncould not result in the very same behaviour that cognitive impressions pro-\nduce” because it is “obviously incorrect”.36 Now if Stoics are Classical Infalli-\nbilists, they need not deny that some cognitive impression and some false im-\npression have the same actual effects. But they need to deny that they would\nhave the same effects even if the subject was attentive enough. Many contempo-\nrary epistemologists find that claim obviously incorrect too. But it is no more\nobviously incorrect than the view that it is in principle possible to avoid false\nbelief entirely, which Stoics clearly held. In fact, as surprising as it may be,\nwe find philosophers holding the view up until the twentieth century. Thus\nG.E. Moore tentatively held that some wakeful experiences are discernible:\n\nBut what I am in doubt of is whether it is logically possible that\nI should both be having all the sensory experiences and the mem-\nories I have and yet be dreaming. The conjunction of the propo-\nsition that I have these sense experiences and memories with the\nproposition that I am dreaming does seem to me to be very likely\nself-contradictory.(Moore, 1993, 194)37\n\nMalcolm argued that the presence of an ink-bottle in front of him was dis-\ncernible:\n\nNow could it turn out to be false that there is an ink-bottle directly\nin front of me on this desk ? [. . . ] It could happen that when I next\nreach for this ink-bottle my hand should seem to pass through it\nand I should not feel the contact of any object. [. . . ] Having admit-\nted that these things could happen, am I compelled to admit that if\nthey did happen then it would be proved that there is no ink-bottle\nhere now? Not at all! (Malcolm, 1952, 185)\n\nAnd the Oxford Realist H.A. Prichard took knowing to be discernible:38\n\nthat does support it is the “ungrounded, and quite implausible, insistence that false impressions\nsimply cannot be as rich and vivid as some true impressions” (Reed, 2002b, 153). That is the\nClassical Infallibilism I claim they held.\n\n36Reed (2002b, 160) approvingly quotes Carneades for that claim (LS 40H, which says that false\nimpressions are “equally self-evident and striking”). But it seems clear to me that it was commonly\ngranted that if Stoics conceded that claim to Carneades they were defeated. If so it would be\nnatural to think that Stoics did hold the view.\n\n37What allowed Moore to hope that the conjunction was logically contradictory was his Ideal-\nist view that ordinary objects were to be analysed in terms of sense-data. See section 4 on how\nClassical Infallibilism motivates Idealism.\n\n38See also Marion (2000a, 313) on Cook Wilson’s infallibilism. Marion (2000a, 314) claims that\non Cook Wilson’s view, knowing p and “being under the impression” that p are indistinguishable.\nBut the passage he quotes suggests that Cook Wilson took them to be distinguishable on reflec-\ntion: “if we really thought we knew, we must have reflected and must have thought the evidence\nconclusive, whereas, ex hypothesi, any reflection shows it could not be conclusive” (my emphasis).\n\n15\n\n\n"
