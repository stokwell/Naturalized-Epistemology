"\nWe must recognise that when we know something we either do, or\nby reflecting, can know that our condition is one of knowing that\nthing, while when we believe something, we either do or can know\nthat our condition is one of believing and not of knowing: so that\nwe cannot mistake belief for knowledge or vice versa.
