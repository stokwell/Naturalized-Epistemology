"\nflourished in recent times.108\n\nA putative role of knowledge is to justify belief.109 Externalist views are\ncriticised for failing to secure it.110 The suggestion is that justified belief re-\nquires some discernible indication of truth. Internalist Infallibilism takes knowl-\nedge to require both a discernible indication and a mark of truth. On pains\nof collapsing into Classical Infallibilism, the same property cannot play both\nroles. But a straightforwardly conjunctive account is likely to face a secondary\nGettier problem: when it is a coincidence that one’s belief bears both a dis-\ncernible indication and a mark of truth, one does not know.111 On better ver-\nsions of the view the mark of truth, while not discernible itself, entails that one’s\nbelief bears a discernible indication of truth. Undefeated Justification accounts\nillustrate the idea. One these accounts knowledge requires a “justification”,\nwhich is taken to be a discernible indication of truth, and in addition that one’s\n“justification” is “undefeated”, where the justification’s being “undefeated” is\nnot discernible but ensures that a belief is true.112 Thus undefeated justifica-\ntion is a mark of truth that entails a discernible indication of truth without\nbeing discernible itself. In the wake of the Gettier problem several Internalist\nInfallibilist accounts appeared.113\n\nAs defined, Externalist and Internalist Infallibilisms are not exclusive. If\nbelieving is discernible, for instance, and if it counts as a sufficient “indication\nof truth”, then the two are coextensive. To specify a divide one needs a notion\nof indication of truth. Internalists with respect to that notion are those who take\nit to be discernible and entailed by knowing. Strict Externalists are those who\ndeny that it is required or that it is discernible. Since there is no uncontroversial\nnotion of indication of truth, there is no uncontroversial way of drawing the\ndivide.114\n\n108Malcolm (1952, 181) distinguished a “strong” and “weak” sense of “know”. Interestingly, he\nupholds Classical Infallibilist standards for the strong sense (see notably Malcolm, 1952, 183–6).\nSee also Stine (1976), Lewis (1979, 1996), Unger (1986), Cohen (1988, 1999), Williams (1991), DeRose\n(1992a, 2009), Hawthorne (2004), Stanley (2005), Fantl and McGrath (2009).\n\n109In the Hellenistic debate is was assumed that knowledge, and only knowledge, would justify\nassent. The Probabilist Sceptical idea that something less could justify belief (and not merely guide\naction) was apparently not introduced before Philo. See sec. 4.5. Lasonen-Aarnio (2010) argues\nagainst the idea that knowledge makes belief reasonable, but leaves open whether a belief can be\nboth justified an unreasonable.\n\n110BonJour (1980), Lehrer (1990, 162–163).\n111The argument in Williamson (2000, 3.2) may be adapted, substituting a candidate discernible\n\ncondition for the internal one.\n112See Howard-Snyder et al. (2003, 306) for the claim that most defeasibility conditions entail\n\ntruth.\n113Lehrer (1965); Chisholm (1966); Sosa (1969); Klein (1971); Harman (1973); Pollock (1986, ap-\n\npendix), and most of the ’fourth-clause’ accounts discussed in Shope (1983). Goldman (1976) and\nLewis (1996) defend accounts according to which (roughly) one knows provided one’s experience\nentails truth over a range of situations relevantly like one’s current situation. Even though these\naccounts are not usually classified as “internalist”, they fall into the Internalist Infallibilist camp if\nthey take experience be discernible.\n\n114Primitivists hold that knowledge is not definable. Since knowing is truth-entailing, they are\n\n36\n\n\n"
