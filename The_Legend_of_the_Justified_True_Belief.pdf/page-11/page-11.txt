The word translated as “cognition” is katalēpsis, a neologism that literally\nmeans apprehension or grasping. Cicero translates perceptio, whose original meaning is taking, col-\nlecting (as in “perceiving taxes”). “Knowledge” is epistēmē.\n\n25See LS 41A, 41B, 41C, 41H and Annas (1990, 187-188). “Immune to objections” corresponds to\nthe Stoic phrase “firm and unchangeable by reason”, which Long and Sedley (1987, 257) interpret\nas being “impregnable to any reasoning that might be adduced to persuade a change of mind”.\n\n26See Fine (2003, 114–5) on Plato’s coherentism about “knowledge” and Barnes (1993, xii-xiii)\nand Burnyeat (1981) on Aristotle’s demonstrative conception of “knowledge”.\n\n27See Barnes (1980, 204): “The verb ’epistasthai,’ and its cognates ’epistēmē’ and ’epistēmōn,’ are\nnot philosophical neologisms; they occur frequently in Greek literature from Homer onwards, and\nthey are there correctly translated by ’know’ and its cognates.” In the Stoic context, Long and\nSedley nevertheless translate epistēmē as “scientific knowledge” (Long and Sedley, 1987, 257).\n\n28Long and Sedley (1987, 257): “It would be possible to translate katalēpsis by ’knowledge’ in\nmany contexts”. See also Annas (1990, 184-185, 189).\n\n29For overviews of Stoic epistemology see Long and Sedley (1987, sections 39-42), Annas (1990)\nand Frede (1999). The account below essentially follows Frede’s (1987; 1999). Reed (2002b, 150n7,\n153n14) suggests that Frede shifted views on whether the Stoics added their third clause as a fur-\nther requirement (in Frede, 1987) or as a clarification of the first two (in Frede, 1999). We should\ndistinguish two issues here: whether satisfying the first two clauses was supposed to entail sat-\nisfying the third and whether the third clause is was supposed to clarify of the first two. What\nmatters for my purposes is the entailment issue, for if early Stoics defended an account on which\n“cognitions” could violate the third clause they were not Classical Infallibilists. Fortunately Frede\nanswered that question positively in both works: see Frede (1987, 165) (“the Stoics think that any\nimpression which satisfies the first two conditions will in fact also satisfy the third”) Frede (1999,\n312) (“Given that the third clause is treated as merely clarificatory and redundant”). The “clarifi-\ncation” issue has no impact on our discussion and the account below is neutral on it.\n\n30See Frede (1987, 152-157). It is controversial whether Stoics thought that all impressions come\nfrom the senses, though that is definitely their paradigmatic case (see Brennan, 1996 for discussion).\nReed (2002b, 169–70) suggests that Stoics only loosely talk of impressions as having content: strictly\nspeaking, they are associated with one or several propositions which are themselves content (or\n\n11\n\n\n""\nis but a fragment of what there was.
