"\nsome are “cognitive”. They are characterized thus:31\n\nA cognitive impression is one which arises from what is and is\nstamped and impressed exactly in accordance with what is, of such\na kind that could not arise from what is not. (LS 40E, see also LS\n40C, 40D)\n\nSince cognitive impressions are “impressed exactly in accordance with what\nis”, beliefs based on them are true (Frede, 1987, 164). So they are marks of\ntruth. Are they discernible? Arguably, that is what the third clause was meant\nto secure. First, Stoics took cognitive impressions to differ from others:\n\n’Of such a kind as could not arise from what is not’ was added by\nthe Stoics, since the Academics did not share their view of the im-\npossibility of finding a totally indiscernible [but false] impression.\nFor the Stoics say that one who has the cognitive impression fas-\ntens on the objective difference of things in a craftsman-like way,\nsince this kind of impression has a peculiarity which differentiates\nit from other impressions, just as horned snakes are different from\nothers. (LS 40E)\n\nThe difference was sometimes said to be that cognitive impressions are “clear\nand distinct” (LS 40C). Second, Stoics thought that it is possible to assent only\nto impressions that are cognitive (LS 40D, 41G). Presumably, that is because a\nsufficiently attentive subject can tell cognitive impressions apart (Frede 1999,\n314–6; as Frede points out, that may involve some training). Thus cognitive\nimpressions are discernible.32\n\nKnowledge requires nothing more. It is not required that one knows, be-\nlieves or is otherwise aware that one’s assent is to a cognitive impression. The\nunwise assent to cognitive and non-cognitive impressions alike, and yet they\nhave knowledge (LS 40C). Nor it is required that one antecedently knows that\ncognitive impressions are true (Frede, 1999, 299, Barnes, 1990, 132–6).\n\nWhile details remain blurry, the overall Stoic picture is clear enough. When\none’s eyes are open, one is close enough and in a well-lit area, one can get an\nimpression of an object of a kind that one could not get otherwise. When the\nconditions are right, one can get an impression of Socrates of a kind that one\ncould not get from a twin. When one is wide awake, one gets impressions such\nthat one could not get while dreaming. More generally, it is always possible to\ndiscern that one’s impression is of the cognitive kind. This does not mean that\n\nhave content; Reed oscillates between the two). The loose reading is enough for present purposes.\n31All Hellenistic texts are cited in Long and Sedley’s (1987) translations.\n32Some texts indicate that they are also convincing, that is, they force assent (LS 40H, 40O). This\n\nmay be what their “clarity and distinction” consists in (Frede, 1987, 168).\n\n12\n\n\n"
