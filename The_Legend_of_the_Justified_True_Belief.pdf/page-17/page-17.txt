Two issues are worth flagging. (1) Conceptual divisions. Medieval epistemology tends to\ndraw on Aristotle and the Stoic-Academic debate. Both arguably distinguish ordinary knowledge\nfrom systematic theoretical knowledge, or, for short, knowledge from science (see fn. 21 above\nand sec. 4.8 below). In Western Europe, however, Cicero’s Academica was barely known (Hunt,\n1998, 26–30) and the main source on the Hellenistic debate is Augustine’s (354–430 CE) Contra\nAcademicos, which fails to heed the distinction. When Western philosophers discovered Aristotle’s\nPosterior Analytics in the twelfth century their translations (e.g. Aquinas’s) did use two terms, sci-\nentia and cognitio, for Aristotle’s epistēmē and gignoskein. But they may understand the distinction\ndifferently: Pasnau (2002, 5–6) suggests that cognitio is the most general term for mental represen-\ntations or thoughts. In practice medieval authors tend instead to theorize the contrast between\nknowledge and science in terms of of grades of scientia (Pasnau, 2010b). As a result, it is sometimes\nhard to tell whether certain views are counterexamples to the New Story. For instance, some late\nmedieval philosophers distinguished a lower sense of “comprehension of truth” or even “knowl-\nedge” that was just true belief (see e.g. Martens, 2011). Did they think that in its most general\nsense knowledge includes mere true belief? Or were they merely pointing out that “grasping the\ntruth” is ambiguous between knowing proper and having a true belief ? (2) Conceptual innovations.\nCertainty (al-yaqı̄n, certitudo) became a central epistemic category with Islamic philosophy (Black,\n2006). Evidentness (evidentia) is another medieval innovation. I suspect that both can be understood\nin Classical Infallibilist terms, but they should be discussed in more detail. It is worth noting that\nmedieval philosophers were almost unanimous in requiring “certainty” for knowledge. Nicholas\nof Autrecourt may be a rare exception (sec. 4.7 below).\n\n46Let me highlight three episodes. (1) Al-Fārābı̄’s non-accidentality clause. Al-Fārābı̄ (c. 872–951)\ncalls certitude the endpoint of Aristotelian demonstration. He lists six conditions for “absolute cer-\ntitude” that p: S believes p, p is true, S knows that p is true, p is necessary, p is eternal, and the\nprevious conditions hold “essentially, not accidentally” (Black, 2006, 16). The issue here is to under-\nstand the relation between certain knowledge—what satisfies the six conditions—and knowledge—\nwhat appears in the third condition. (Black (2006, 20) points out that al-Fārābı̄ could have used\na different Arabic word for the latter but he did not. That suggests that he deliberately avoided\nto reproduce Aristotle’s distinction between epistēmē and gignoskein.) Now al-Fārābı̄ spelled out\nthe “necessity” and “eternity” clauses in ways that arguably makes them not modal or temporal\nbut rather some kind of infallibility requirement (see Black, 2006 for an enlightening discussion).\nIf so the sixth clause suggests that one could satisfy the knowledge clause without satisfying the infal-\nliblity ones. That would make al-Fārābı̄ a counterexample to the New Story. Black (2006, 29–31)\nhowever suggests the the clause is in fact superfluous. (2) Divine illumination theories. Relying on\nCicero, Augustine’s Contra Academicos raises the core issue of the Hellenistic debate and defends on\nbroadly Epicurean answer (Bolyard, 2006). The Epicurean view ensures the truth of all impressions\n\n17\n\n\n""\nthat by criterion of truth they meant discernible marks of truth.\n\n4 Classical Infallibilism in Western Philosophy\n\nThe New Story’s bold hypothesis is that before 1950, virtually every Western\nphilosopher was a Classical Infallibilist.
