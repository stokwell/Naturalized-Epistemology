"\nthe two.99 Thus he takes “grounds” to be discernible but not truth-entailing.\nHe concludes that “strong” but non truth-entailing “grounds”, in conjunction\nwith truth, are sufficient for knowledge. In a somewhat prescient way, Mal-\ncolm finds “surprising” that truth alone could make the difference between\nknowing and not knowing:\n\nAs philosophers we may be surprised to observe that it can be that\nthe knowledge that p is true should differ from the belief that p is\ntrue only in the respect that in one case p is true and in the other\nfalse. But that is the fact. (Malcolm, 1952, 180)\n\nHe nevertheless sticks to the conclusion because he thinks that the only alterna-\ntive is to require the discernibility of knowing, which entails an unacceptable\nlevel of scepticism.100\n\nInternalist Fallibilists maintain that knowledge requires a discernible prop-\nerty, but deny that it must be truth-entailing. They take over the Probabilistic\nSceptics’ notion of discernible indication of truth and the idea that such an indica-\ntion is enough to justify belief.101 But they add that in conjunction with truth, it\nis also sufficient for knowledge. After Malcolm’s seminal paper, the view was\nadopted by Chisholm (1956, 447 and 1957, 1, 16) and Ayer (1956, 34). That is\nthe familar Justified True Belief analysis. Its main flaw was quickly pointed out\nby Gettier (1963). In some cases it is a coincidence that the two conditions are\nsatisfied; in such cases one does not know. The view was consequently all but\ngiven up.102 Far from being a long-held conception, the Justified True Belief\nanalysis’s shelf-life was a mere eleven years.\n\nThe Gettier problem threatens any analysis of knowledge as a conjunction\nof truth with a non-truth entailing condition. Its apparent lesson is that knowl-\nedge requires a truth-entailing condition.103 Externalist Infallibilists took up the\nsuggestion. On their view knowledge requires a mark of truth, but not a dis-\ncernible one. A Crude Causal account illustrates the idea.104 Say that a belief is\n\n99Malcolm (1952, 179): “Was there any way that you could have discovered by reflexion [sic], in\ncase (5), that you did not know ? It would have been useless to have reconsidered your grounds\nfor saying that there would be water, because in case (4), where you did know, your grounds were\nidentical. [. . . ] Prichard says that we can determine by reflexion whether we know something or\nmerely believe it. But where, in these cases, is the material that reflexion would strike upon ? There\nis none.”\n\n100Malcolm (1952, 179). If the Legend was true, it would be strange for Malcolm to be surprised.\nIt is worth noting that Malcolm’s objection to scepticism is not merely that it is at odds with ordi-\nnary use. For he adds: “We do not think of our usage as being loose or incorrect—and it is not.”\n(Malcolm, 1952, 179, my emphasis). Thus he is just as much making the common sense objection\nthat we obviously know many things and that it is prima facie extremely implausible to deny it.\n\n101See sec. 4.5 above on indications of truth and Probabilist Scepticism.\n102See however Hetherington (1999) and Weatherson (2003) for a spirited defence.\n103Sturgeon (1993), Zagzebski (1994), Merricks (1995).
