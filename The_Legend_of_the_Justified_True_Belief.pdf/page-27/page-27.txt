"\n4.7 Hard cases: Autrecourt, Buridan, Reid, Ramsey\n\nNicholas of Autrecourt (c. 1295–1369) famously argued that the scope of the\n“evident” is restricted to what cannot logically be false: analytical claims and\nmaybe a restricted class of impressions.79 His arguments are consistent with a\nClassical Infallibilist account of the “evident”. However, he appeared to have\nalso held that knowledge extends beyond the “evident” to the “probable”.80\n\nIn doing so, he appears to reject Classical Infallibilism. He would thus be a\ncounterexample to the bold hypothesis. It is worth noting, however, that his\nviews were widely taken to entail skepticism, because it was widely assumed\nthat knowledge required “evidentness”. That is consistent with the hypothesis\nthat most of his contemporaries endorsed Classical Infallibilism.\n\nJohn Buridan (c. 1295–1363) was one of those who thought that Autrecourt’s\narguments would lead to scepticism. However his own epistemology has a\nfallibilist flavour too.81 There are two reasons for this. First, he allows a stan-\ndard of “evidentness” that is not truth-entailing but sufficient for moral con-\nduct. His example is that of a magistrate who, after diligent investigation, “acts\nwell and meritoriously” in hanging an innocent. The notion prefigures that of\n“moral certainty” and the legal standard of “beyond reasonable doubt”.82 Un-\nfortunately, it is not clear whether he counts that type of “evidentness” as a\n“certainty” and as sufficient for knowledge.83 He may be a Probabilistic Scep-\n\n79On Autrecourt’s epistemology see Zupko (1993, 193–5), Thijssen (2000) and Grellard (2005,\n2010). In his First Letter to Bernard of Arezzo he argues that if, as Arezzo contains, impressions are\ndistinct from their objects, then “every impression we have of the existence of objects outside of\nour minds can be false” (3, Klima, 2007, 134). However in his Exigit ordo he claims that “apparences\n(in the strict sense) are not [false]” and he takes wakeful appearances to be “different in kind” from\nones in dreams (see Grellard, 2010, 130-1). So his claim that every impression can be false may have\nbeen conditional on premisses he rejected.\n\n80See Grellard (2010, 132–6).\n81See Zupko (1993), Klima (2009, 237–45), Pasnau (2010a, 30–7), Karger (2010, 221–3). Buri-\n\ndan’s discussion is framed in terms of scientia but it covers ordinary knowledge, e.g. knowing that\nSocrates is running or that the sun is bright (Summulae de Dialectica, bk. 8, ch. 4, sec. 4, Klima, 2007,\n146).\n\n82Quaestiones in Aristotelis Metaphysicam, Bk. 2 q. 1, trans. Klima (2007, 146): “there is an even\nweaker kind of evidentness that suffices for acting morally well, namely, when someone, hav-\ning seen and investigated all relevant facts and circumstances that man can diligently investigate,\nmakes a judgement in accordance with these circumstances, then his judgement will be evident\nwith the sort of evidentness that suffices for acting morally well, even if the judgement is false, be-\ncause of some insurmountable ignorance of some circumstance. For example, it would be possible\nfor a magistrate to act well and meritoriously in hanging a holy man because from testimonies and\nother legal evidence it sufficiently appeared to him concerning this good man that he was an evil\nmurderer.” See (Pasnau, 2010a, 33 and n12) on the legacy of the notion.\n\n83Pasnau (2010a, 36) argues that the question would be irrelevant to Buridan and scholastic\nphilosophers: “the question of whether it is certain enough to count as knowledge is not the\nscholastic question. For them, as I have been stressing, epistemic states occur along a contin-\nuum without sharp breaks, and there is accordingly little point in worrying about whether a given\ncontext is now so far from the ideal that it should no longer count as scientia.” I agree with much\nof Pasnau’s picture (see below) but not with that part. Buridan’s scale of epistemic states is not a\ncontinuum. It has well-defined cut-off points: the supernaturally unfalsifiable, the naturally unfal-\nsifiable, the naturally falsifiable. He also takes seriously the question how far scientia applies: he\n\n27\n\n\n"
