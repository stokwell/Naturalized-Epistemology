"\nfully manifests itself is the criterion of truth according to Carneades\nand his followers. As the criterion, it has a considerable breadth,\nand by admitting of degrees, it includes some impressions which\nare more convincing and striking in their form than others. [. . . ]\nHence the criterion will be the impression which appears true—also\ncalled ’convincing’ by the Academics—but there are times when it\nactually turns out false, so that it is necessary actually to use the im-\npression which is common on occasion to truth and falsehood. Yet\nthe rare occurrence of this one, I mean the impression which coun-\nterfeits the truth [i.e., the second], is not a reason for distrusting the\nimpression [i.e. the third] which tells the truth for the most part.\nFor both judgements and actions, as it turns out, are regulated by\nwhat holds for the most part. (LS 69D)\n\nConvincing impressions are discernible: they contrast with “confused” and\n“indistinct” ones, they have an “intensity of appearing true” and they “man-\nifest themselves”. But they are not truth-entailing. They are merely reliable:\nthey are true “for the most part”—that is, only most of them are true. Both\ndimensions admit of degrees. We may call indication of truth a property of a\nbelief such that most beliefs who have it are true. Carneades’s suggestion is\nthat action could be guided by a discernible indication of truth.\n\nImportantly, Carneades did not think that indications of truth (perhaps in\nconjunction with truth) are enough for knowledge (e.g. LS 69F). Thus he did\nnot challenge Classical Infallibilism. Rather, he targeted the Stoics’ assumption\nthat one should act only on the basis of what one knows.70 His successor Philo\nof Larissa appears to have taken a step further and targeted the widely shared\nHellenistic view that one should believe only what one knows.71 He held that\nconvincing impressions would justify some form of assent, opinion.72\n\n70See LS 69A. The Stoic assumption has been revived in the contemporary context by Unger\n(1975, chap. 5). Burnyeat (npub) argues that Carneades’s rejoinder to Stoics is not that convincing\nimpressions justify actions, but rather than their fallibility fails to justify suspension.\n\n71Before Philo, and even after him, few challenged Sceptics on the idea that if nothing was\nknown, nothing should be “assented” to. Moreover, I suspect that even within the post-Philo\ntradition it was held that there is a kind of “assent” (typically, subjective certainty) reserved to\nwhat was known. The idea that beliefs of any type can be equally justified when one knows as\nwhen one does not is a contemporary one. In recent years the traditional view that one should\nbelieve only what one knows has been revived by Unger (1975, chap. 5), Williamson (2000, 47;\n2007), Sutton (2007), Haddock (2010), Littlejohn (2014).\n\n72“[. . . ] the wise man will assent to what is incognitive, i.e. will opine, but in such a way that he\nrealizes that he is opining and knows that there is nothing which can be grasped and cognized.”\n(LS 69K) That is the (looser) sense in which convincing impressions are said to be “criteria of truth”\nabove. Philo (via his main pupil Antiochus, whose lectures Cicero attended) is one of our main\nsources and he was keen to present his own views as continuous with those of Carneades. Thus\nwhile some texts say that Carneades called convincing impressions “criteria of truths” and allowed\nforming opinion on their basis, a number of commentators think that Carneades restricted them to\naction-guidance, did not call them “criteria” and only put forward the view dialectically, as a way\n\n24\n\n\n"
