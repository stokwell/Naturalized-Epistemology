29. Ibid., p. 13. I should note that Kitcher considers the apsychologistic ap- 

proach to be an aberration of the twentieth century epistemology, as 
represented by philosophers like Russell, Moore, C.I. Lewis, and 
Chisholm, rather than an historical characteristic of the Cartesian tradi- 
tion. In "The Psychological Turn", Australasian Journal of Philosophy 
60 (1982): 238-253, Hilary Kornblith gives an analogous characteriza- 
tion of the two approaches to justification; he associates "justification- 
conferring processes" with the psychologistic approach and "epistemic 
rules" with the apsychologistic approach.

32. The aptness of this characterization of the "apsychologistic" approach 

for philosophers like Russell, Chisholm, Keith Lehrer, John Pollock, etc. 
can be debated. Also, there is the issue of "internalism" vs. "externalism" 
concerning justification, which I believe must be distinguished from the 
psychologistic vs. apsychologistic division.

34. Richard Rorty's claim, which plays a prominent role in his arguments 
against traditional epistemology in Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature, 
that Locke and other modern epistemologists conflated the normative 
concept of justification with causal-mechanical concepts is itself based, 
I believe, on a conflation of just the kind I am describing here. See Ror- 
ty, ibid., pp. 139ff. Again, the critical conflation consists in not seeing 
that the view, which I believe is correct, that epistemic justification, like 
any other normative concept, must have factual, naturalistic criteria, 
is entirely consistent with the rejection of the doctrine, which I think 
is incorrect, that justification itself is, or is reducible to, a naturalistic- 
nonnormative concept.

37. Ernest Sosa, too, considers epistemological supervenience as a special 

case of the supervenience of valuational properties on naturalistic con- 
ditions, in "The Foundation of Foundationalism", Nous 14 (1980): 547-64; 
especially p. 551. See also James Van Cleve's instructive discussion in 
his "Epistemic Supervenience and the Circle of Belief", The Monist 68 
(1985): 90-104; especially, pp. 97-99. 

38. Perhaps one could avoid this kind of criteriological regress by embrac- 
ing directly apprehended valuational properties (as in ethical intuitionism) 
on the basis of which criteria for other valuational properties could be 
formulated. The denial of the supervenience of valuational concepts on 
factual characteristics, however, would sever the essential connection 
between value and fact on which, it seems, the whole point of our valua- 
tional activities depends. In the absence of such supervenience, the very
