notion of valuation would lose its significance and relevance. The 
elaboration of these points, however, would have to wait for another 
occasion; but see Van Cleve's paper cited in the preceding note for more 
details. 

39. Quine will not disagree with this: he will "naturalize" them both. For 
his views on values see "The Nature of Moral Values" in Alvin 1. Goldman 
and Jaegwon Kim (eds.), Values and Morals (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978). 
For a discussion of the relationship between epistemic and ethical con- 
cepts see Roderick Firth, "Are Epistemic Concepts Reducible to Ethical 
Concepts?" in the same volume. 

40. For discussions of this and related issues see Goldman, Epistemology 
and Cognition. 

41. For a detailed development of a normative ethical theory that exemplifies 
the view that it is crucially relevant, see Richard B. Brandt, A Theory 
of the Good and the Right (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1979). 

42. An early version of this paper was read at a meeting of the Korean Socie- 
ty for Analytic Philosophy in 1984 in Seoul. An expanded version was 
presented at a symposium at the Western Division meetings of the 
American Philosophical Association in April, 1985, and at the 
epistemology conference at Brown University in honor of Roderick 
Chisholm in 1986. 1 am grateful to Richard Foley and Robert Audi who 
presented helpful comments at the APA session and the Chisholm Con- 
ference respectively. I am also indebted to Terence Horgan and Robert 
Meyers for helpful comments and suggestions.
