What is "Naturalized Epistemology"? / 401 

history of philosophy; however, what our textbooks say about the history 
of a philosophical concept has much to do with our understanding of 
that concept. 

2. Alvin Goldman explicitly states this requirement as a desideratum of 
his own analysis of justified belief in "What is Justified Belief?", in George 
S. Pappas (ed.), Justification and Knowledge (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1979), 
p. 1. Roderick M. Chisholm's definition of "being evident" in his Theory 
of Knowledge, 2nd ed. (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,1977) does 
not satisfy this requirement as it rests ultimately on an unanalyzed 
epistemic concept of one belief being more reasonable than another. 
What does the real "criteriological" work for Chisholm is his "principles 
of evidence". See especially (A) on p. 73 of Theory of Knowledge, which 
can usefully be regarded as an attempt to provide nonnormative, descrip- 
tive conditions for certain types of justified beliefs. 

3. The basic idea of this stronger requirement seems implicit in Roderick 
Firth's notion of "warrant-increasing property" in his "Coherence, Cer- 
tainty, and Epistemic Priority", Journal of Philosophy 61 (1964): 545-57. 
It seems that William P. Alston has something similar in mind when he 
says, "... like any evaluative property, epistemic justification is a superve- 
nient property, the application of which is based on more fundamental 
properties" (at this point Alston refers to Firth's paper cited above), in 
"Two Types of Foundationalism", Journal of Philosophy 73 (1976): 165-85 
(the quoted remark occurs on p. 170). Although Alston doesn't further 
explain what he means by "more fundamental properties", the context 
makes it plausible to suppose that he has in mind nonnormative, descrip- 
tive properties. See Section 7 below for further discussion. 

4. See Chisholm, ibid., p. 14. Here Chisholm refers to a "person's respon- 
sibility or duty qua intellectual being". 

5. This term was used by A.J. Ayer to characterize the difference between 
lucky guessing and knowing; see The Problem of Knowledge (New York 
& London: Penguin Books, 1956), p. 33.

7. See Rudolf Carnap, "Testability and Meaning", Philosophy of Science 

3 (1936), and 4 (1937). We should also note the presence of a strong 
coherentist streak among some positivists; see, e.g., Carl G. Hempel, 
"On the Logical Positivists' Theory of Truth", Analysis 2 (1935): 49-59, 
and "Some Remarks on 'Facts' and Propositions", Analysis 2 (1935): 93-96.

umbia University Press, 1969). Also see his Word and Object (Cambridge: 
MIT Press, 1960); The Roots of Reference (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1973); 
(with Joseph Ullian) The Web of Belief (New York: Random House, 1970); 
and especially "The Nature of Natural Knowledge" in Samuel Guttenplan 
(ed.), Mind and Language (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1975). See Frederick 
F. Schmitt's excellent bibliography on naturalistic epistemology in Hilary 
Kornblith (ed.), Naturalizing Epistemology (Cambridge: MIT/Bradford, 
1985).

of meaning.
