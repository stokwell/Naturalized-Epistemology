10. I know of no serious defense of it since Ayer's The Foundations of Em- 
pirical Knowledge (London: Macmillan, 1940).

of Nature (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), p. 11. 
14. Elliott Sober makes a similar point: "And on the question of whether 

the failure of a foundationalist programme shows that questions of 
justification cannot be answered, it is worth noting that Quine's advice 
'Since Carnap's foundationalism failed, why not settle for psychology' 
carries weight only to the degree that Carnapian epistemology exhausts 
the possibilities of epistemology", in "Psychologism", Joumal of Theory 
of Social Behaviour 8 (1978): 165-191.

16. "If we are seeking only the causal mechanism of our knowledge of the 

external world, and not a justification of that knowledge in terms prior 
to science ...", Quine, "Grades of Theoreticity", in L. Foster and J.W. 
Swanson (eds.), Experience and Theory (Amherst: University of 
Massachusetts Press, 1970), p. 2.

20. But aren't there those who advocate a "causal theory" of evidence or 

justification? I want to make two brief points about this. First, the 
nomological or causal input/output relations are not in themselves 
evidential relations, whether these latter are understood causally or 
otherwise. Second, a causal theory of evidence attempts to state criteria 
for "e is evidence for h" in causal terms; even if this is successful, it does 
not necessarily give us a causal "definition" or "reduction" of the con- 
cept of evidence. For more details see section 6 below. 

21. 1 am not saying that Quine is under any illusion on this point. My remarks 
are directed rather at those who endorse Quine without, it seems, a clear 
appreciation of what is involved. 

22. Here I am drawing chiefly on Donald Davidson's writings on radical in- 
terpretation. See Essays 9, 10, and 11 in his Inquiries into Truth and 
Interpretation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984). See also David Lewis, 
"Radical Interpretation", Synthese 27 (1974): 33144. 

23. Robert Audi suggested this as a possible objection. 
24. For some considerations tending to show that these correlations can- 

not be lawlike see my "Psychophysical Laws", in Ernest LePore and Brian 
McLaughlin (eds.), Actions and Events: Perspectives on the Philosophy 
of Donald Davidson (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985). 

25. For a more sympathetic account of Quine than mine, see Hilary Korn- 
blith's introductory essay, "What is Naturalistic Epistemology?", in Korn- 
blith (ed.), Naturalizing Epistemology.
