Two important themes underlie these convictions: first, values, 
though perhaps not reducible to facts, must be "consistent" with them 
in that objects that are indiscernible in regard to fact must be indiscer- 
nible in regard to value; second, there must be nonvaluational 
"reasons" or "grounds" for the attribution of values, and these 
"reasons" or "grounds" must be generalizable-that is, they are 
covered by rules or norms. These two ideas correspond to "weak 
supervenience" and "strong supervenience" that I have discussed 
elsewhere.36 Belief in the supervenience of value upon fact, 
arguably, is fundamental to the very concepts of value and valua- 
tion.37 Any valuational concept, to be significant, must be govern- 
ed by a set of criteria, and these criteria must ultimately rest on fac- 
tual characteristics and relationships of objects and events being 
evaluated. There is something deeply incoherent about the idea of 
an infinitely descending series of valuational concepts, each depen- 
ding on the one below it as its criterion of application.38 
It seems to me, therefore, that epistemological supervenience is 

what underlies our belief in the possibility of normative epistemology, 
and that we do not need new inspirations from the sciences to 
acknowledge the existence of naturalistic criteria for epistemic and 
other valuational concepts. The case of normative ethics is entirely 
parallel: belief in the possibility of normative ethics is rooted in the 
belief that moral properties and relations are supervenient upon non- 
moral ones. Unless we are prepared to disown normative ethics as 
a viable philosophical inquiry, we had better recognize normative 
epistemology as one, too.39 We should note, too, that epistemology 
is likely to parallel normative ethics in regard to the degree to which 
scientific results are relevant or useful to its development.40 Saying 
this of course leaves large room for disagreement concerning how 
relevant and useful, if at all, empirical psychology of human motiva- 
tion and action can be to the development and confirmation of nor- 
mative ethical theories.41 In any event, once the normativity of 
epistemology is clearly taken note of, it is no surprise that 
epistemology and normative ethics share the same metaphilosophical 
fate. Naturalized epistemology makes no more, and no less, sense 
than naturalized normative ethics.42
