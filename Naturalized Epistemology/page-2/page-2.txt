WHAT IS "NATURAUZED EPISTEMOLOGY?"

ought to reject them, that he ought not to accept them as true. We 
can view Cartesian epistemology as consisting of the following two 
projects: to identify the criteria by which we ought to regulate ac-

be said to know according to those criteria. Descartes' epistemological 
agenda has been the agenda of Western epistemology to this day. 
The twin problems of identifying criteria of justified belief and com- 
ing to terms with the skeptical challenge to the possibility of 
knowledge have defined the central tasks of theory of knowledge 
since Descartes. This was as true of the empiricists, of Locke and 
Hume and Mill, as of those who more closely followed Descartes in 
the rationalist path.' 

It is no wonder then that modern epistemology has been dominated 
by a single concept, that of justification, and two fundamental ques-

justified in accepting it as true? and What beliefs are we in fact justified 
in accepting? Note that the first question does not ask for an "analysis" 
or "meaning" of the term "justified belief". And it is generally assum-
