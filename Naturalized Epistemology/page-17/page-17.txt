given in logical terms. We are concerned with logical 
relations among propositions, not with psychological 
relations among mental states. 

On the other hand, the psychologistic approach considers the crucial 
difference between knowledge and true belief-that is, epistemic 
justification-to turn on "the factors which produced the belief", focus- 
ing on "processes which produce belief, processes which will always 
contain, at their latter end, psychological events".29 

It is not entirely clear from this characterization whether a 
psychologistic theory of justification is to be prohibited from mak- 
ing any reference to logical relations among belief contents (it is dif- 
ficult to believe how a theory of justification respecting such a blanket 
prohibition could succeed); nor is it clear whether, conversely, an 
apsychologistic theory will be permitted to refer at all to beliefs qua 
psychological states, or exactly what it is for a theory to do so. But 
such points of detail are unimportant here; it is clear enough, for 
example, that Goldman's proposal to explicate justified belief as belief 
generated by a reliable belief-forming process30 nicely fits Kitcher's 
characterization of the psychologistic approach. This account, one 
form of the so-called "reliability theory" of justification, probably was 
what Kitcher had in mind when he was formulating his general 
characterization of epistemological naturalism. However, another in- 
fluential form of the reliability theory does not qualify under Kitcher's 
characterization. This is Armstrong's proposal to explain the dif- 
ference between knowledge and true belief, at least for non- 
inferential knowledge, in terms of "a law-like connection between 
the state of affairs [of a subject's believing that p] and the state of 
affairs that makes 'p' true such that, given the state of affairs [of the 
subject's believing that p], it must be the case that p."31 There is here 
no reference to the causal antecedents of beliefs, something that 
Kitcher requires of apsychologistic theories. 
Perhaps, Kitcher's preliminary characterization needs to be 

broadened and sharpened. However, a salient characteristic of the 
naturalistic approach has already emerged, which we can put as 
follows: justification is to be characterized in terms of causal or 
nomological connections involving beliefs as psychological states or 
processes, and not in terms of the logical properties or relations per- 
taining to the contents of these beliefs.32 

If we understand current epistemological naturalism in this way,
